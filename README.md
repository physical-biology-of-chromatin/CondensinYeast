# CondensinYeast
## Overview

This repository contains a theoretical framework based on Gaussian approximation to compute the contact probability generated by Condensin loaded on a specific loading site with different roadblocks.

## Input Parameters

The following parameters are required to run the computation:

- **Chromosome length (L)**: The total length of the chromosome.
- **Processivity (p)**: The average distance that Condensin can travel along the chromosome.
- **Density of bound Condensin (d)**: The density of Condensin molecules bound to the chromosome.
- **Gamma exponent (γ)**: A parameter related to the scaling behavior of the contact probability.
- **Roadblock parameters**:
  - **Densities ({a_i})**: The densities of various roadblocks.
  - **Positions ({l_i})**: The positions of the roadblocks on the chromosome.
  - **Domain sizes ({Δl_i})**: The sizes of the domains created by the roadblocks.

## Output

The output of the computation is the ratio of contact probability (with Condensin/without Condensin) as a function of genomic distance.

## Usage

To use this framework, provide the necessary input parameters as specified above. The framework will then calculate and return the contact probability ratio as a function of the genomic distance.
